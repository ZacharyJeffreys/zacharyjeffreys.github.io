          <p>This research was conducted to provide objective measurements to determine if college students recall information better with auditory or with visual memory cues. This has been a controversial topic for decades, but modern research still lacks concrete evidence for which learning method is the most effective for college students. The experiment consisted of a within subject design where a group of college students were split into two groups. Each student received an identification number based on the order they took our experiment. The first student to partake in the experiment was assigned to an identification number of 1 and the second participant was assigned to an identification number of 2. All the odd numbered participants were assigned to group A, while all the even number participants were assigned to group B. During the experiment the students in group A was first exposed to a line of eleven characters visually presented, while the students in group B were first presented with auditory cues from a voice recording. The participants were then told to write down the characters that they could recall. We then repeated the same procedures with the opposite conditions for each group. Our results determined that people recalled the number of visual cues 1.5 times more profoundly than when they were presented with auditory cues and that our data was statistically significant. From our experiment we found that it would be more beneficial for professors to use visual cues when teaching their students than using auditory cues.

          <p>This study uses an objective analysis to measure peoples “ambition to travel”. Ambition to travel is how diligently someone would work and the amount of resources someone would give up to be able to travel. The data was collected using a 21 items Qualtrics online survey, then was compiled to determine if the survey accurately measures someone’s ambition to travel. From the study it was found that the scale had acceptable face and construct validity and was moderately reliable. It was also found that people from the lower and middle socio-economic classes had the highest ambition to travel. The findings from this study can help future researchers attempt to understand why people have a different level of psychological needs, drives and ambitions to travel.
