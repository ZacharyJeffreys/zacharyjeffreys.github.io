      <h3> About Me </h3>
      <p> The name is zach, the game is software development. Growing up in Seattle,
        I have always been around new technology. In college, I wanted to know how to
        conduct research and undertand peoples behaviors so I studied Psychology. At the
        same time, I found a passion for coding. Now, I am using my background is Psychology
        to help use technology to help people overcome problems they have in their day to day life.

        <div id = "BustleProblem">
          <h2> The Problem :</h3>
          <p> This project was orignially started becasue I wanted an easier way to find events or activities to
            to on the same day, without having to look though the hundreds of events on different platforms.
         </p>
         <h2> The solution: </h3>
           <p>After contemplating this issue for awhile, I began to go through my tinder, and started to think
             that it would be alot easier to find things to do if you could just swipe like tinder, and the app
             did all the work of finding the events for you. So I though that I would start to code a prototype.
           </p>
          <h2> Persona and User Story</h2>
           <p> Other than the tinder card idea, I didnt know what the app should look like so I began to
             to try and figure out the ideal user, and the process of how they would go through the app.
             So after a few interviews with some close friends, I found out the that the idea user was _
             ________. And that they liked the idea, but they would like a way to connect what their
             likes with their friends.
            </p>
            <h3> The Wire-Frame</h3>
            <p> After figuring out what I needed to have in the app, I made a simple wireframe drawn on
              a piece of paper to see what I needed the client side UI to look like. I then had a few of my
              friends look over it and give me feedback.
            <h3> The First Prototype.</h3>
            <p> Now, the fun part was here, coding the front-end of the iOS application. I started off
                with just attempting to figure out how to have the cards stacked on top of each other,
                while using gesture recognizers to determine when the card was swiped left versus right.</p>
            <h3> The Completed Protype </h3>
            <p> To have this prototype be able to carry information from different viewController, and to save
              memomory, I decided to use Firebase as a back-end. From here, I ran it on my phone so that
              I could see what my freinds thought about it. After getting some feed back, I continued to
              make revisions, until I had a version I was proud of. </p>

          <p>The Goal: To create a simple API, Server, and connection to a MongoDB.</p>
          <p> I began this project to learn how to intergrate my front-end design with a Node.js backend so I could learn how
            API's work. I first created the front-end using a simple HTML page with inputs for dogs name, breed, and other requirements,
            and then used an express GET request to send information from the user to a MongDB Atlas database. I then used an embeded JavaScript
            to POST data from the database into an HTML formatted page so the users could see the dogs in the database. </p>

          <img src = "C:\Users\zacha\OneDrive\Pictures\Saved Pictures\Research Studies\Factor Analysis .jpg">

          <p>This research was conducted to provide objective measurements to determine if college students recall information better with auditory or with visual memory cues. This has been a controversial topic for decades, but modern research still lacks concrete evidence for which learning method is the most effective for college students. The experiment consisted of a within subject design where a group of college students were split into two groups. Each student received an identification number based on the order they took our experiment. The first student to partake in the experiment was assigned to an identification number of 1 and the second participant was assigned to an identification number of 2. All the odd numbered participants were assigned to group A, while all the even number participants were assigned to group B. During the experiment the students in group A was first exposed to a line of eleven characters visually presented, while the students in group B were first presented with auditory cues from a voice recording. The participants were then told to write down the characters that they could recall. We then repeated the same procedures with the opposite conditions for each group. Our results determined that people recalled the number of visual cues 1.5 times more profoundly than when they were presented with auditory cues and that our data was statistically significant. From our experiment we found that it would be more beneficial for professors to use visual cues when teaching their students than using auditory cues.

          <p>This study uses an objective analysis to measure peoples “ambition to travel”. Ambition to travel is how diligently someone would work and the amount of resources someone would give up to be able to travel. The data was collected using a 21 items Qualtrics online survey, then was compiled to determine if the survey accurately measures someone’s ambition to travel. From the study it was found that the scale had acceptable face and construct validity and was moderately reliable. It was also found that people from the lower and middle socio-economic classes had the highest ambition to travel. The findings from this study can help future researchers attempt to understand why people have a different level of psychological needs, drives and ambitions to travel.
