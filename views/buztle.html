      <p>Buztle is a event finding app that uses ML to help its users find activites
      that they would be interested in, and then" connects them with their friends
      who are interested in the same activities. </p>

      <div class="project">
        <h4>Project:</h4>
        <p>The goal of this project was to create a user freindly prototype for an event finidng mobile application
        that simplified the Users Experience with the app.</p>
        <h4>Objective: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Condcut Usability test to see how users interact with other event finding applications</li>
          <li>Create a Persona and User story for the target user</li>
          <li>Program a prototype for the idea </li>
          <li>Conduct Usability test to ensure app simplified user experience</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Process</h4>
        <p>1) The first step of this project was to review other applications such as Eventbrite and Meetup
        to see how users interacted witht them. Based of our observations, we found that there were too many options
        that were unrelivant to the users so the users lost interest quickly. </p>
        <p>2) We had to create a persona and user story so that we could interact with the application. To find
        this out we used surveys to collect data on users that would use the product, and usablity testings with
        a simple wire-frame. From this we found:
      </p>

      <h5>Persona(example Change this): </h5>

      <h5>User Story:</h5>
      <img src="https://www.computercareers.org/wp-content/uploads/User-Story.png" alt="">
      </center>
      <p>3) After brainstorming some ideas with alot of sticky notes, we found that the most user-friendly
        idea would be to use a tinder like card idea, that has an algorithem that takes in users data when
        they swipe left or right, and learns what their interst are. This way they wouldnt have to look through all
        the options. Also based off our Persona and demographic data we found, we beleived that most
        of the users in the age group would be tech savy enough to understand how to use the product.
       </p>
       <p>4) The next step was to create a prototype for the Minimum Viable Product. For this I coded an iOS application via SWIFT that had views
       assorted in a stack, that allowed the users to swipe left, or right. It also allowed users to save events,
      and to create their own events. We decided to use Firebase as a back-end so that we could get a rapid working prototype
    up and running. </p>
      </div>
      <p>5) The last step I contributed to the product was to create usablity test to ensure that the product
      solved the problem for the users of too many unrelevant options. we found that it did solve the issue, button beacuase
      there wasnt a complete back-end our results were limited.
